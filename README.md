This is a Terminal App

i plan to make this app like a terminal/code editor hybrid and also ı plan to add features like compatibility with game engines or some programs like blender ect...

for now it is realy does nothing but in the feature ı hope it will do all the things i tell about

in order to download the -Node_Moduels- you should type "npm i electron" to Terminal of your vsCode or whatever you are using

this should download the -Node_Moduels- , i also typed "resize-img" - "toastify-js", this two downloaded some extra thing but you dont need all of this 

if it gives you a -"running scripts is disabled on this system"- like error just type -"Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass"-

then you can type "npm i electron" and this time it should work
